## 1. Project Overview

Understanding customer behavior is crucial for creating personalized marketing strategies. This project utilizes the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers into meaningful groups based on behavioral data.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze customer data to identify distinct clusters.
- Provide actionable insights into customer behavior for improved marketing strategies.

---

## 2. Dataset

The dataset contains customer data including demographics, purchase history, and other relevant metrics.

### Key Information:
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
- **Size:** Several columns representing various behavioral and demographic attributes.
- **Target Analysis:** Unsupervised clustering (no target variable).

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Addressed missing values and normalized the data for better clustering results.
- Explored patterns in features such as spending habits and demographics.

---

## 4. Clustering Analysis

### Methodology:
- Applied KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their similarities.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

---

## 5. Insights and Recommendations

### Key Results:
- Customers were segmented into **three distinct clusters** representing unique behavioral traits.
- Each cluster provides valuable insights for designing targeted marketing campaigns and retention strategies.
